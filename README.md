üîñ **Project Title & Description**

**Personal Portfolio Website v2** is a modern, interactive web application designed to showcase a developer's projects, skills, and professional experience. This portfolio website serves as a digital resume and project gallery, targeted at developers, designers, and tech professionals looking to present their work to potential employers, clients, and collaborators. Key features include dynamic project displays fetched from GitHub, smooth animations, and an interactive AI chatbot accessible via a hovering button, enabling visitors to ask questions about the developer's background, projects, and expertise in real-time. In an increasingly digital job market, a well-crafted portfolio website is essential for standing out, demonstrating technical abilities, and building a personal brand. This project matters because it provides a platform for continuous learning display, project documentation, and professional networking, ultimately facilitating career opportunities and collaborations.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**

- **Language**: TypeScript for type-safe development
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Package Manager**: Bun for lightning-fast package installation and script execution
- **UI Framework**: React with TypeScript for component-based architecture
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first, responsive styling
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth, performant animations and transitions
- **API Integration**: GitHub API for dynamically fetching and displaying project repositories
- **Deployment**: (To be determined - potentially Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages)

üß† **AI Integration Strategy**

Throughout the development process, AI tools will be leveraged to accelerate coding, ensure quality, and maintain comprehensive documentation. The primary AI assistant (GitHub Copilot in VS Code) will be used as follows:

**Code Generation**: The IDE's AI agent will scaffold initial project structure, React components, TypeScript interfaces, and API integration logic. For example, prompts like "Create a React component for displaying project cards with TypeScript props" or "Generate a custom hook for fetching GitHub repositories" will be used to bootstrap features quickly while maintaining best practices.

**Testing**: AI will assist in writing comprehensive test suites, including unit tests for individual components and integration tests for API interactions. Prompts such as "Write Vitest unit tests for the ProjectCard component" or "Create integration tests for GitHub API error handling" will ensure robust test coverage and help catch bugs early in development.

**Documentation**: AI will help craft and maintain documentation throughout the project. This includes generating detailed README sections, writing docstrings for functions and components, and adding inline comments to explain complex logic. The AI will also assist in updating documentation as the project evolves, ensuring it remains accurate and comprehensive.

**Context-Aware Techniques**: To maximize AI effectiveness, relevant context will be provided in prompts, including:
- GitHub API documentation snippets for accurate integration
- Project file structure and component hierarchies for consistent code generation
- Code diffs and error messages for targeted debugging assistance
- User stories and design requirements for feature implementation
- Existing codebase patterns to maintain consistency across the project

This AI-driven approach will enable rapid prototyping, maintain high code quality, and ensure thorough documentation, allowing focus on creative aspects of portfolio design and user experience.
