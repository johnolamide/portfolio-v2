üîñ **Project Title & Description**

**Personal Portfolio Website v2** is a dynamic web application that allows any GitHub user to generate a personalized portfolio dashboard by entering their GitHub username. Upon input, the app fetches the user's profile data, repositories, and activity via the GitHub API, then renders a custom dashboard with project showcases, skills visualization, and an AI-powered chatbot. The chatbot is context-aware, drawing from the user's GitHub data (e.g., bio, repos, languages, contributions) to answer questions about their background, projects, and expertise in real-time. This makes the portfolio a versatile tool for developers to quickly create shareable, data-driven profiles without manual setup, while the AI enhances interactivity by providing personalized insights. This shift emphasizes accessibility and scalability: anyone with a GitHub account can instantly generate a professional-looking portfolio, fostering community sharing and networking. It matters in a competitive tech landscape by democratizing portfolio creation and enabling AI-assisted self-presentation.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**

- **Language**: TypeScript for type-safe development
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Package Manager**: Bun for lightning-fast package installation and script execution
- **UI Framework**: React with TypeScript for component-based architecture
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first, responsive styling
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth, performant animations and transitions
- **API Integration**: GitHub API for dynamically fetching and displaying project repositories; Axios for HTTP requests
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts for interactive charts (e.g., skills breakdown)
- **AI Chatbot**: Google Gemini API for natural language processing and context-aware responses
- **Deployment**: (To be determined - potentially Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages)

üß† **AI Integration Strategy**

Throughout the development process, AI tools will be leveraged to accelerate coding, ensure quality, and maintain comprehensive documentation. The primary AI assistant (GitHub Copilot in VS Code) will be used as follows:

**Code Generation**: The IDE's AI agent will scaffold initial project structure, React components, TypeScript interfaces, and API integration logic. For example, prompts like "Create a React component for displaying project cards with TypeScript props" or "Generate a custom hook for fetching GitHub repositories" will be used to bootstrap features quickly while maintaining best practices.

**Testing**: AI will assist in writing comprehensive test suites, including unit tests for individual components and integration tests for API interactions. Prompts such as "Write Vitest unit tests for the ProjectCard component" or "Create integration tests for GitHub API error handling" will ensure robust test coverage and help catch bugs early in development.

**Documentation**: AI will help craft and maintain documentation throughout the project. This includes generating detailed README sections, writing docstrings for functions and components, and adding inline comments to explain complex logic. The AI will also assist in updating documentation as the project evolves, ensuring it remains accurate and comprehensive.

**Context-Aware Techniques**: To maximize AI effectiveness, relevant context will be provided in prompts, including:
- GitHub API documentation snippets for accurate integration
- Project file structure and component hierarchies for consistent code generation
- Code diffs and error messages for targeted debugging assistance
- User stories and design requirements for feature implementation
- Existing codebase patterns to maintain consistency across the project

**Runtime AI Features**: The application itself incorporates AI through the interactive chatbot, which uses Google's Gemini API to provide context-aware responses based on the user's GitHub data. The chatbot can be prompted with questions about the portfolio owner's background, projects, and skills, enhancing user engagement and providing personalized insights.

This AI-driven approach will enable rapid prototyping, maintain high code quality, and ensure thorough documentation, allowing focus on creative aspects of portfolio design and user experience.
