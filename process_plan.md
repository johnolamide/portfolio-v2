# Project Process Plan: Personal Portfolio Website v2

This docume## 5. AI Chatbot Implementation
- [x] Set up Gemini API client configuration
- [x] Create system prompt to guide AI responses based on GitHub data context
- [x] Create chatbot UI component (modal/sidebar with input/output)
- [x] Implement context preparation from GitHub data
- [x] Build prompt engineering for user queries
- [x] Add chatbot state management (conversation history)
- [x] Integrate real-time responses from Gemini API
- [x] Implement error handling for API failures
- [x] Add chatbot customization options (e.g., personality settings)s the step-by-step process to build the dynamic portfolio website that generates custom dashboards from GitHub usernames, featuring an AI chatbot powered by Google's Gemini API. By default, it showcases the portfolio for username "johnolamide", but users can enter any GitHub username to generate their own dashboard. It serves as a progress tracker, with each step marked as pending ([ ]) or completed ([x]). Update the status as you progress.

## Prerequisites
- [x] Install Bun runtime (for package management)
- [x] Set up Node.js (if needed as fallback)
- [x] Obtain GitHub Personal Access Token (recommended for higher rate limits - 5000 vs 60 requests/hour)
- [x] Set up Google Cloud account and enable Gemini API
- [x] Install VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension

## Database Requirements
**No database is required** for this project. The application is designed as a client-side portfolio generator that fetches data in real-time from the GitHub API. All user data is ephemeral and not stored persistently. For potential future enhancements (like user analytics or caching), a lightweight database could be considered, but it's not necessary for the core functionality.

## User Flow
1. **Landing Page**: User visits the website and sees a clean interface with a GitHub username input field pre-filled with "johnolamide" (the default portfolio)
2. **Username Input**: User can keep the default username or enter their own GitHub username (e.g., "johnalokan") and click submit
3. **Data Loading**: Application displays a loading state while fetching user profile, repositories, and activity from GitHub API
4. **Dashboard Display**: Custom portfolio dashboard renders with:
   - User profile section (avatar, bio, stats)
   - Skills visualization chart
   - Repository grid with project details
   - Activity timeline
5. **AI Interaction**: User clicks the floating chatbot button to open the AI assistant
6. **Chat Experience**: User can ask questions like "Tell me about your top projects" or "What technologies do you specialize in?" - the AI responds based on the fetched GitHub data
7. **Sharing**: User can copy a shareable URL for their generated portfolio
8. **Re-generation**: User can enter a different username to generate another portfolio instantly
